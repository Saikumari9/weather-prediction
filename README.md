Weather Prediction:
This repository contains code for weather prediction authored by Saikumari Pilli. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to forecast weather conditions based on historical data. The provided code, implemented in Python, utilizes popular libraries like TensorFlow, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: The notebook includes comprehensive steps for cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering of weather data sourced from Kaggle. Techniques such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables are applied.
Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks are trained using TensorFlow. Each model's performance is evaluated to determine the best predictive approach.
Evaluation and Prediction: The trained models are rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics, and then employed to forecast weather conditions based on provided input data.
Usage:
Open the provided notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code and experiment with different models and parameters.
Customize input data for weather prediction according to the format specified in the notebook.
Note:
This project is intended for educational purposes and may require further refinement for practical applications.
